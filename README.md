"# Blog Platform Readme File"

<!-- Project Overview -->

This project is a blog platform built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). The platform allows users to sign up, log in, and perform various blog-related activities such as creating, editing, and deleting blogs. Additionally, users can view and comment on blogs from other users. Authentication is implemented using JWT (JSON Web Token) to protect user data and routes.
